# Theory Exploration Packages #

These are all of the tools used for Haskell theory exploration. Each is a
standalone project with its own git repository. They are included here as git
submodules, in order to aid reproducibility.

If the directories are empty, you can populate them using:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Otherwise, you can keep them as they are to reproduce experimental results with
the same versions. To use different versions of these packages, you can follow
the instructions at http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
