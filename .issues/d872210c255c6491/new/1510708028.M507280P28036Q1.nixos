Subject: Include sampled names in benchmark output
Message-Id: <d872210c255c6491-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Looking through the sampled TIP benchmarks, it looks like we're not
including the sampled names. This is unfortunate, since that's one of
the "inputs"; it can be regenerated deterministically from the size and
rep, but that requires the te-benchmark version to be the same.
