Subject: Make bucketing standalone, for reuse by other tools
Message-Id: <aa35984a8448f916-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Rather than having separate theory exploration tools (HashSpec, MLSpec,
etc.) we can instead make bucketing into a generic pre-processor, which
can be tested on different tools.

In particular, timing how long the bucketing takes isn't particularly
interesting: we can assume it's pretty darn fast. If not, we can just
benchmark it separately, rather than complicating the timing of the
exploration phase.
