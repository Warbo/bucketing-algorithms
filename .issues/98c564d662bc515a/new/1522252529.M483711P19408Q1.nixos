Subject: Bucket sampling needs ASTs
Message-Id: <98c564d662bc515a-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

We've got samples of names, but when we bucket we need to provide the
ASTs.

We could do this in the Python script which invokes the bucketing
scripts, since there's no need to have the ASTs duplicated over and over
among the samples.
