# Haskell Theory Exploration #

This repository is designed to allow reproducible experiments in theory
exploration, in the Haskell language.

## Scripts ##

### `getPackageList.sh` ###

Fetches the latest list of packages available from hackage.haskell.org

The results are, by their nature, subject to change; hence the list of packages
used in an experiment should be kept alongside the results.

### `shufflePackages.sh` ###

Outputs (the latest version of) each package in `index.tar.gz` (as fetched by
`getPackageList.sh`), in a random order. This is designed to allow a random
set of packages to be used in experiments; we can't select a set of packages
based just on their names, since some may fail to compile or may not provide any
functions to explore.

By emitting all packages in a random order, we can loop through them, extracting
functions from each until we have the desired number. Hence the results of this
script don't necessarily need to be kept, as long as we keep the set of packages
eventually obtained.

### `getPackages.sh` ###

Fetch packages from hackage.haskell.org
