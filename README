# Haskell Theory Exploration #

This repository is designed to allow reproducible experiments in theory
exploration, in the Haskell language. Many separate tools are used in this
implementation, tied together using the Nix expression language.

## Quick Summary ##

 - You'll need the Nix package manager and a UNIX-like OS (tested on Linux). Nix
   will take care of gathering any other dependencies.
 - Invoke `test.sh` to run all tests.
 - Benchmarks are stored in `benchmarks/`, in the smtlib derivative used by the
   Tons of Inductive Problems (TIP) project.
 - Invoke `run-benchmarks.sh` to benchmark QuickSpec and MLSpec.

## Benchmarks ##

The files ending `.smt2` in the `benchmarks` directory are theories which will
be benchmarked by running `run-benchmarks.sh`. These are in a derivative of the
smtlib format, as used by the Tons of Inductive Problems (TIP) project. We use
software from the TIP project to translate these into Haskell source code
suitable for the included tools.

The benchmarks are as follows:

 - `benchmarks/nat-simple.smt2` is a simple theory of Natural numbers, with
   addition and multiplication, comparable to that used in [1] and [2]
 - `benchmarks/nat-full.smt2` is similar to `nat-simple.smt2` but also contains
   exponentiation and maximum functions, comparable to that used in [3]
 - `benchmarks/list-full.smt2` is a theory of lists, comparable to that used
   in [2]
 - `benchmarks/tip/*.smt2` are theories generated by the
   `benchmarks/tip/make_benchmarks.sh` script, by taking a random selection of
   functions from the TIP benchmarks suite. The benchmarks used for experiments
   are kept in version control, to ensure reproducibility. New benchmarks can be
   generated by re-running the `make_benchmarks.sh` script.
