## Bucketing Algorithms ##

This repo contains algorithms which take in a JSON array of (Haskell Core) ASTs
and spits out an array of arrays ("buckets"). Each "bucket" is an array of
strings, where those strings come from the "name" attributes of the given ASTs.

The idea of "bucketing" in this way is to try and group "related" ASTs together,
most notably as a way to carve up large packages into sub-sets suitable for
"theory exploration" tools like QuickSpec and Speculate.
