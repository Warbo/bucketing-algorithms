# Haskell Theory Exploration #

This repository is designed to allow reproducible experiments in theory
exploration, in the Haskell language. Many separate tools are used in this
implementation, tied together using the Nix expression language.

## Quick Summary ##

 - You'll need the Nix package manager and a UNIX-like OS (tested on Linux). Nix
   will take care of gathering any other dependencies.
 - Invoke `test.sh` to run all tests.
 - Results are cached by Nix.
