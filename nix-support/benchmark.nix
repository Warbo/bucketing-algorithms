      Benchmarking shell: use the 'asv' command to run benchmarks. If you want
      to avoid building environments for each git revision, and instead use a
      single environment based on this directory's contents (as they were when
      'nix-shell' was called, at least) then you can give 'asv run' the option
      '-E "existing:$existing/bin/python". This is especially useful if we don't
      have a .git directory (e.g. if this directory was obtained using the
      'fetchgit' or 'fetchFromGitHub' Nix functions).

      By default, the HTML generated by 'asv publish' won't work when accessed
      via 'file://' URLs. To fix this, you can run 'fixHtml /path/to/html/dir'.
