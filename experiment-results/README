# Results of Bucketing Experiments #

This directory is used to store data generated by experiments testing these
bucketing algorithms. Each directory in here should be named after the git
commit that the experiments were performed with, and should contain its own
README detailing what the results are and how to reproduce them.

Since these results will never be altered, they should be compressed (preferably
using lzip).
