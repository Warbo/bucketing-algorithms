# Theory Exploration Benchmark Groud Truth Recall #

These results come from `nix-support/proportionExperiment.nix`. They should be
deterministic, and hence easily reproducible, but are saved here because they
take a long time to run (around a day). The files are:

samples.json.lz: Sets of names sampled from the Theory Exploration Benchmark.

withBuckets.json.lz: The same samples, but bucketed pseudorandomly (AKA hashed)
and using recurrent clustering.

withBucketsGroundTruths.json.lz: The same buckets, annotated with the theorems
which are possible to find if they were explored.

withBucketsGroundTruthProportions.msgpack.lz: The same buckets, annotated with
the proportion of each sample's theorems that remain possible to find when
bucketed.

averageBucketProportions.msgpack.lz: The same proportions, averaged.

bucketBounds.json.lz: Samples taken from haskell-te repository, bucketed
optimally and pessimally using constraint satisfaction, annotated with ground
truth proportions.
